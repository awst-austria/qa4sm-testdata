		Abstract: In 1998 the High Plains Regional Climate Center upgraded stations in the Automated Weather Data Network (AWDN) to monitor soil water at 14 sites in Nebraska. The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) has provided soil moisture sensors for some of the sites. Currently, sensors are placed at 10, 25, 50, and 100 cm below the surface at each site. AWDN technicians maintain the sensors and laboratory facilities were updated to include adequate test and calibration equipment. The network archives the data for a daily time step.

	BNZ-LTER
		Abstract: The Bonanza Creek (BNZ) LTER project was initiated in 1987 and since then has provided experimental and observational research designed to understand the dynamics, resilience, and vulnerability of Alaska"s boreal forest ecosystems. The project has illuminated the responses of boreal forest organisms and ecosystems to climate and various atmospheric inputs, focusing on forest and landscape dynamics and biogeochemistry. This project will continue that long-term line of research, expanding it to broaden the landscape under study, broaden the predictive realm of the resulting information, and to directly address the resilience of socio-economic systems. The project hypothesizes that the past observed high resilience of boreal ecosystems to interannual and decadal changes in environmental conditions is approaching a critical tipping point., 
This project contributes to understanding of the structure, function, and dynamics of boreal forest ecosystems and the broader boreal landscape, including the human communities. It assembles and integrates valuable long-term data sets on climate, hydrology, biology, ecology, and biogeochemical and geomorphic processes, as incorporates emerging data types, including molecular and social science data and digital images. The project has broad societal value through its contributions to knowledge that can inform management of boreal forest ecosystems and sustainability of subsistence communities. Its broader values also include extensive research-based training and educational program development. Its strong public outreach program includes collaborations between artists and scientists and strong linkages with Native organizations.

	COSMOS-UK
		Abstract: The COSMOS-UK network is established and operated by the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (UKCEH). It is the first network to systematically measure soil moisture throughout the UK, and represents a range of climate, soils and vegetation. The network consists of ~50 sites, each recording a number of hydrometeorological and soil variables. Each site hosts a cosmic-ray neutron sensor (CRNS); a novel sensor technology which counts fast neutrons in the surrounding atmosphere. In combination with the recorded hydrometeorological data, neutron counts are used to derive Volumetric Water Content (VWC) over a field scale (~0.1 km2) (COSMOS VWC), at daily resolution. Alongside the CRNS, each site hosts several point soil moisture probes recording at 30 minute resolution. More information is available from the COSMOS-UK website: https://cosmos.ceh.ac.uk/ . The full dataset, along with quality flags, is available at: https://doi.org/10.5285/5060cc27-0b5b-471b-86eb-71f96da0c80f .


************************************************************************************************************
IMPORTANT NOTE: The Cosmic-ray neutron sensor (CRNS) is placed just above the ground and counts the naturally occurring neutrons (originating from cosmic rays). The neutrons are scattered by hydrogen atoms, which are present primarily in the soil water. The CRNS neutron count rate (after corrections) reduces with increasing soil moisture content, and can therefore be used, via a calibration curve, to infer the soil Volumetric Water Content (VWC). The CRNS counts neutrons which may have been scattered many times, such that they may have interacted with the ground soil moisture over distances of more than 200 m from the probe, and from tens centimetres of soil depth. This local scattering of neutrons determines the horizontal and vertical footprint of the sensor, or the measurement support volume, and yields the important characteristic of averaging the soil moisture measurement over a large area. Using neutron scattering models, the typical footprint is determined (~12 hectares), although there is some dependence on the VWC, particularly for the soil depth of measurement. For this reason, the CRNS depth of measurement is given as an average for the time series and location, but it should be appreciated that actual sensing depth will be reduced in wet conditions, compared with dry conditions (from around 10 cm to 30 cm depth respectively).

	CTP_SMTMN
		Abstract: A dense monitoring network that consists of 56 stations is established on the central Tibetan Plateau to measure two state variables (soil moisture and temperature) at three spatial scales (1.0, 0.3, 0.1 degree) and four soil depths (0~5, 10, 20, and 40 cm). Elevations of these stations vary over 4470~4950 m. The experimental area is characterized by low biomass, high soil moisture dynamic range, and typical freeze-thaw cycle. As auxiliary parameters of this network, soil texture and soil organic carbon content are measured at each station to support further studies. All the sensors have been calibrated by taking account of the impact of soil texture and soil organic carbon content on the measurements. 
As the highest soil moisture network above sea level in the world, this network meets the requirement for evaluating a variety of soil moisture products and for soil moisture scaling analyses. 
Note that, 
a)	some of the stations are shared by two or three sub-scale networks (indicated by the station names) and thus the number of station names is up to 69 in total; 
b)	in order to ensure the continuous measurements of the near surface (0~5 cm) SM/TM, the original surface layer sensor (when get damaged) is usually replaced with another sensor at deeper depth during field maintenance. Therefore there may be offset in a time series before and after the replacing time point (shown in Table 1).

	DWD
		Abstract: The soil-physical boundary conditions of the soil moisture probes used were determined for the individual sites during installation by means of simple soil sampling and finger tests on the basis of the Soil Science Mapping Guide (KA 5). At present, however, calibration sampling is still being carried out at the sites and, in the future, site-specific soil physics laboratory tests are also planned. The measured values should therefore be regarded and used as preliminary raw data, particularly with regard to the absolute level.


************************************************************************************************************
Die bodenphysikalischen Randbedingungen der eingesetzten Bodenfeuchtesonden sind für die einzelnen Standorte beim Einbau durch einfache Bodenansprachen und Fingerproben auf der Basis der Bodenkundlichen Kartieranleitung (KA 5) festgelegt worden. Derzeit werden an den Standorten aber noch Kalibrierbeprobungen vorgenommen und perspektivisch sind auch standörtliche bodenphysikalische Laboruntersuchungen geplant. Die Messwerte sollten deshalb insbesondere bezüglich des absoluten Niveaus als vorläufige Rohdaten betrachtet und verwendet werden.

	LAB-net
		Abstract: In Chile, remote sensing applications related to soil moisture and evapotranspiration estimates have increased during the last decades because of the drought and the water use conflicts which generate a strong interest on water demand. To address these problems on water balance in large scales by using remote sensing imagery, LAB-net was created as the first soil moisture network located in Chile over four different land cover types. These land cover types are vineyard and olive orchards located in a semi-arid region of Copiapó Valley, a well irrigated raspberry crop located in the central zone of of Tinguiririca Valley and a green grass rangeland located Austral zone of Chile. Over each site, a well implemented meteorological station is continuously measuring a 5 minute intervals above the following parameters: soil moisture and temperature at two ground levels (5 and 20 cm), air temperature and relative humidity, net radiation, global radiation, brightness surface temperature (8 – 14 µm), rainfall and ground fluxes. This is the first approach of an integrated soil moisture network in Chile. The data generated by this network is freely available for any research or scientific purpose related to current and future soil moisture satellite missions.

		Abstract: Soil moisture datasets for 78 districts have been prepared by Vladimir Zabelin from the Russian Hydrometeorological Center, Moscow, Russia. The soil moisture observations were taken using the gravimetric technique and were provided as volumetric plant-available water [%] for the upper 20 cm and 1 m soil layers at agricultural fields. Thus volumetric soil moisture [m^3/m^3] was calculated by first extracting texture properties of all sites from the Harmonized World Soil Database and subsequently calculating the wilting levels for all stations using the equations of Saxton and Rawls (2006).
As this dataset was designed for monitoring of soil moisture at agricultural fields datasets were seperately available for spring cereal crops and winter cereal crops for all locations. In the ISMN stations with the suffix "a" represent spring cereal crops while stations with "b" illustrate winter cereal crops. Measurements are available during the growing period from 1987 to 1988, three times a month.

Volumetric soil moisture [m^3/m^3] was calculated by first extracting texture properties of all sites from the Harmonized World Soil Database and subsequently calculating the wilting levels for all stations using the equations of Saxton and Rawls (2006).
For the period 1952 to 1985 soil moisture measurements for the layer 0-100 cm are provided for some stations. Measurements of the upper 10 cm soil layer are available for the period 1977 to 1985.

	RUSWET-VALDAI
		Abstract: Soil moisture datasets for 3 catchments located at the Valdai basin were collected by the State Hydrological Institute in St. Petersburg from 1960 to 1990. The catchments differ in their vegetation, Usadievskiy has mostly grassland vegetation, Tayozhniy a mature forest and Sinaya Gnilka was articifally forested in 1961. 
The soil moisture was computed by using data from 9-11 observational points distributed over the basin area. The resulting files contain monthly means of soil moisture for the layers of 0-20, 0-50 and 0-100 cm. These files were downloaded from the "Global Soil Moisture Database" and transformed into volumetric soil moisture [m^3/m^3]. Thus soil moisture values are available as monthly means, precipitation as monthly totals [mm] and temperature [°C] as daily values. Other variables measured but not included into the ISMN are runoff, averaged water table depth, averaged water equivalent snow depth and averaged evaporation.

	SD_DEM
		Abstract: Meteorological data and soil data have been collected at a site in the central Sudan from 2002 to 2012. The site is a sparse savanna in the semiarid region of Sudan. In addition to basic meteorological variables, soil properties (temperature, water content, and heat flux) and radiation (global radiation, net radiation, and photosynthetic active radiation) were measured. The dataset has a temporal resolution of 30 minutes and provides general data for calibration and validation of ecosystem models and remote-sensing-based assessments, and it is relevant for studies of ecosystem properties and processes.

	SMN-SDR
		Abstract: The SMN-SDR was established during the Soil Moisture Experiment in the Luan River of China (SMELR, Zhao et al., 2020), from July 18, 2018 to September 28, 2018.
The coverage of entire network is about 10,000 km2 (115.5-116.5°E, 41.5-42.5°N). 
The topography of the SMN-SDR is relatively flat, and land surfaces are typically dominated by grasslands and croplands.
A total of 34 stations are set up in the network with three sampling scales including 100 km (large scale), 50 km (medium scale), and 10 km (small scale).
These were initially designed to match different scales of land surface modelling and various satellite products (SMAP, SMOS, AMSR2, and downscaled soil moisture products).
The soil moisture sensors used are Decagon 5TM with five measuring depths (3, 5, 10, 20, and 50 cm) installed for each station. 
Of the 34 station, there are 20 stations equipped with HOBO rain gauges.
Undisturbed soil samples at each layer of soil for each station was taken to analyze the gravimetric/volumetric water content, bulk density, and soil texture for a further specific calibration. 
The power supply is provided by solar panels and all data can be transmitted wirelessly to a server. 
The sampling interval of the data recording time is 10 (before June 2019) or 15 minutes (after June 2019).
This network can improve the comprehensive observation capabilities of key water cycle parameters in the ShanDian River basin and provide long-term ground reference data for satellite- and model-based soil moisture products.

	SNOTEL
		Abstract: The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) installs, operates, and maintains an extensive, automated system to collect snowpack and related climatic data in the Western United States called SNOTEL (for SNOwpack TELemetry). The system evolved from NRCS"s Congressional mandate in the mid-1930"s "to measure snowpack in the mountains of the West and forecast the water supply." The programs began with manual measurements of snow courses; since 1980, SNOTEL has reliably and efficiently collected the data needed to produce water supply forecasts and to support the resource management activities of NRCS and others.

	TWENTE
		Abstract: The Twente region in the east of the Netherlands hold a network that monitors since 2009 profile soil moisture and temperature at twenty locations mostly in the rural environment. In addition, intensive measurement campaigns have been performed in 2009, 2015, 2016, and 2017 at number of measurement locations as a part of MSc and PhD research. The development of the network infrastructure has been supported through various EU and NWO-funded projects, and forthcoming data has been successfully used for the validation of satellite derived surface soil moisture products. The early development of the network has been described in Dente et al. (2011), but over the years the design of the network has altered considerably with the most recent updates documented in Van der Velde et al. (2021). In 2019, the Twente network has been operational for more than a decade and with this deposit we would like to make this data freely and well documented available for use by the science and professional communities. An accompanying data paper is under development and will be submitted to Earth System Science Data journal, which provide additional background information.

	WEGENERNET
		Abstract: The WegenerNet Feldbach Region is a unique weather and climate observation network comprising more than 150 hydrometeorological stations measuring temperature, humidity, precipitation, and at 14 locations also wind speed and direction. Soil moisture and soil temperature are measured at 12 stations, which are part of the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN). 


The stations are located in a tightly spaced grid within a core area of 22 km x 16 km centered near the city of Feldbach in southeastern Austria.
With about one station every two square-km (area of about 300 square-km in total), and each station with 5-min time sampling, the network provides fully automated regular measurements since January 2007.

	XMS-CAT
		Abstract: The soil monitoring network is a set of stations with continuous data recording of physics parameters (temperature and moisture of soil) and environmental parameters such as pluviometry, temperature, relative air humidity and solar radiation. Project started at Tremp basin’s, in the crops of vineyards, and it has been continued in high altitude vineyard form Pre-pyrenees and Pyrenees. The main features that set up the stations are the sensors installed into the soils and the basic operation elements, such as the acquisition data system, the power system and the data transmission system. Generally, there are 4 multi parametric sensors to 5, 20, 50 and 100 cm of depth, when parent material allows it, these sensors measure soil moisture and temperature. Each station also has environmental sensors such as a rain gauge, a pyranometer and a air temperature and relative humidity probes for the necessary comparison of the soil and environmental parameters.
